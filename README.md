# Eurodisplay-LaTeX

Reconstructed the MS Word paper template for Eurodisplay 2020 conference in LaTeX.

It's not *exactly* like the Word template (like in per pixel exactly) but good enough that nobody will notice I guess.

**This is not an official template! I do not provide any warranty!**

For now, the template searches for fonts in the .tex file's directory.
